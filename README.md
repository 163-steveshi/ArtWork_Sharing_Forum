# ArtWork_Sharing_Forum
 
This a Website for Users to show/view their artworks and host workshop. Notice, username and artwork 
name are case sensitive. For example, if you register an account with the user, then you should not type 
user when you try to log in. The same rule is applied to the artwork name. A user can be verified as an 
artist once a user submits his/her work to the website. By default, you can only get a normal (patron) 
viewer account.
